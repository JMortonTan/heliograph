Heliograph
====================

###About

Heliograph is a web application with mobile and desktop functionality
that allows users to meet their everyday heroes in real time, just as
disaster occurs.

From a flat tire, to a mucked up shirt, send a call for help from
anywhere and be able to communicate with people who want to help
immediately.  Or, be a hero and scan the feed for people in distress!

- Cleanup Existing Code.
	- Proper formatting/Spacing.

- Migrate to Digital Ocean (?)
- Implement other communication features (IE face chat) with Kandy API
